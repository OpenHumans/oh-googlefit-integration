# Open Humans Google Fit data integration

*This is a Django/Celery application which takes the user through authorization steps with Open Humans and Google Fit and and then adds their Google Fit data into their Open Humans account.*

This repo is based on the Open Humans [data demo template project](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-demo-template). It uses the Google Fit API to get your activity.
