# Open Humans Fitbit data integration

*This is a Django/Celery application which takes the user through authorization steps with Open Humans and Fitbit and and then adds their Fitbit data into their Open Humans account.*

This repo is based on the Open Humans [data demo template project](https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-data-demo-template). It uses the Fitbit API to get your activity.
