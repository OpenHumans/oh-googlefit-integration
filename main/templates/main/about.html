        <h2>Data access &amp; data management</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Google Fit data:</b> The Google Fit API gives this project ongoing
          access to data, which we will collect and store for you in
          Open Humans in an ongoing manner. Depending on how you use the app,
          this may include: steps, active minutes, estimated calories expended,
          and distance traveled.
        </p>
        <p>
            Data files created by the app are stored in your Open Humans
            account and are always visible to you on the
            <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/google-fit/">project
            activity page</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Depending on how you use the app, Google Fit's API also gives us
          access to data we will not copy into your Open Humans account,
          including: height, weight, nutrition, and heart rate. Access to
          this data is unavoidable due to how the API operates, but we won't
          store it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Other data:</b> This project stores tokens for Open Humans and
          Google Fit authorizations, but has no further access to your Open Humans
          account data beyond the data files it stores.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Removing this connection:</b> You can visit the
          <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/activity/google-fit/">project
            activity page</a> in Open Humans to remove this connection within
            Open Humans and, optionally, delete associated data files.
        </p>
        <h2>Code &amp; deployment</h2>
        <p>
          This project website is an
          <a href="https://github.com/OpenHumans/oh-googlefit-integration">open source Django app</a>,
          and is deployed using
          <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. It uses our
          <a href="https://www.openhumans.org/direct-sharing/oauth2-features/">standard APIs</a>
          to interact with the main platform. That means you could build something
          like it! We love to support projects created by others â€“ please chat with
          us in our <a href="http://slackin.openhumans.org">community slack</a>.
        </p>
